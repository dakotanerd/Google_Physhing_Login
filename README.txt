Author: Dakota Wellerbrady
Course: CS 4404

----------------------------------------
Project Overview
----------------------------------------
This project demonstrates how a fake Google login page can be created 
to highlight the dangers of phishing attacks. 

It is strictly for educational purposes only â€” the intent is to raise 
awareness about human vulnerabilities and the risks of interacting 
with suspicious websites.

Disclaimer:
This project must not be used for malicious activity. Attempting to steal 
credentials or mislead real users is illegal and unethical. 
The code provided here does not conceal network information (such as open 
ports, sockets, or IP addresses), making it unsuitable for real-world attacks.

----------------------------------------
Setup & Usage
----------------------------------------
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   Example:
   cd "C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Desktop\stuff\FakeGoogleLogIn"
3. Start the application:
   node index.js
4. You will see a URL in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
5. Open this URL in your browser to view the fake login page.
6. To stop the server, press Ctrl + C (you may need to press twice).
